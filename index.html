                <p> Every professional has a background in certain field of Studies.Some change their career due to economic reason, professional dynamism or other 'force majure', while others are so static and keep their as-is profession.Underlining an endless human interest, I certainly align myself with the first group.</p>
        
                <p> My great passion is throwing myself to a challenging professional environment {emp, in a professional perspective} to get a diverse experience and knowledge.

                and I believe that I have to be trained in certain fields,and so I have been studied different field of studies including Law, Conflict Resolution,Financial Service and, know in computer programing aspect.</p>
